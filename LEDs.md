Here are just some thoughts about driving the LEDs

== Powering the LEDs
Constant current source: maybe something like http://www.tbideas.com/blog/build-an-arduino-shield-to-drive-high-power-rgb-led/

MOSFETS for PWM: http://www.reichelt.de/IRFZ-44N/3/index.html?&ACTION=3&LA=446&ARTICLE=8820&artnr=IRFZ+44N

== Cooling
As the LEDs will draw a lot of power, cooling will be necessary
